# Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, 
# except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. 

# centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
# centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5
# centered_average([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3
